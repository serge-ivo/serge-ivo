# Hi, I’m Serge 👋

I build software products and help teams ship them well.

I’ve worked across full-stack engineering, product direction, and delivery for 20+ years, often in early-stage and greenfield environments. I’m hands-on when it’s useful (architecture, critical-path work, reviews) and I care a lot about the conditions that make teams effective: clear goals, practical standards, and a culture of ownership.

## What I tend to work on
- Product and platform building from idea → MVP → iteration
- Team practices that improve delivery, quality, and momentum
- JavaScript/TypeScript systems on modern cloud platforms
- Automation-heavy workflows and cost-aware data design
- Bridging product, operations, and engineering

## What you’ll find here
A curated set of repos and experiments. I keep things small, practical, and review-friendly.
