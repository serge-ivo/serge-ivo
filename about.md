# Hi, I’m Serge 👋

**Technical Lead (Head of Engineering track) | Product & Delivery | Team Builder**

I build software products — and the teams and delivery rhythm that ship them.

With 20+ years across full-stack engineering, product strategy, and delivery leadership, I work best in startup and greenfield environments where speed matters, but quality and reliability can’t slip. I’m hands-on when it counts (architecture, critical-path builds, reviews), and I’m equally focused on creating high-trust teams with clear goals, strong standards, and a culture of ownership.

## What I’m focused on
- **Organizational leadership:** building teams, mentoring, hiring, and setting practical standards  
- **Product strategy:** turning ambiguity into a roadmap and measurable outcomes  
- **Stakeholder management:** bridging clients, product, ops, and engineers  
- **Delivery management:** cadence, quality, and shipping predictable increments  
- **Modern platforms:** JS/TS systems on cloud, automation-heavy workflows, cost-aware architecture

## Selected work (start here)
- **Firestore Wrapper** — drop-in Firestore wrapper adding safe defaults and rate limiting

- **Firestore Client (@serge-ivo/firestore-client)** — structured Firestore access patterns with cost/abuse controls  
  https://github.com/serge-ivo/firestore-service

- **Static Website Template** — modern web starter (React/Vite/Firebase) with delivery-oriented setup

- **Fireflies Attendance Filler** — automation pipeline (webhooks → processing → Google Sheets output)

## Startups I’m building
- **SeedStart** — platform + methodology for founders to go from idea → team → MVP → launch  
- **Agent Coder** — AI-powered coding assistant focused on developer speed and workflow

## What I’m open to
Technical Lead roles with a clear pathway to **Head of Engineering**, where I can grow teams, strengthen delivery, and build the next level of product capability.
