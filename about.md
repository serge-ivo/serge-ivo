# Hi, I’m Serge 👋

I build software products and help teams ship them well.

I’ve worked across full-stack engineering, product direction, and delivery for 20+ years, often in early-stage and greenfield environments. I’m hands-on when it’s useful (architecture, critical-path work, reviews) and I care a lot about the conditions that make teams effective: clear goals, practical standards, and a culture of ownership.

## What I tend to work on
- Product and platform building from idea → MVP → iteration
- Team practices that improve delivery, quality, and momentum
- JavaScript/TypeScript systems on modern cloud platforms
- Automation-heavy workflows and cost-aware data design
- Bridging product, operations, and engineering

## What you’ll find here
A curated set of repos and experiments. I keep things small, practical, and review-friendly.

## Projects

### SeedStart
A platform and methodology to help founders go from idea → team → MVP → launch, with a volunteer-friendly operating model.
I lead end-to-end development (product definition, architecture, implementation, releases) and keep a steady delivery cadence through clear milestones and rituals.

### Agent Coder
An AI-powered coding assistant focused on developer workflows.
I’m building the core “assistant loop” that turns code context into useful suggestions, plus the product surface and onboarding that make it easy to adopt and iterate on.

### JobSearch.Works
A job search platform built around automation and practical workflows for candidates.
I’ve led product and engineering direction end-to-end and stayed close to delivery—from early prototypes through production iteration—while balancing speed, quality, and cost.

### BetaBuilders
A community-driven initiative that supports early-stage founders with coaching, team formation, and product delivery.
I’ve focused on building repeatable processes for onboarding, collaboration, and shipping—so contributors can make meaningful progress with part-time availability.
